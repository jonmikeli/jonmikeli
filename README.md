- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonmikeli
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. In a few words, creating value, learning, improving day after day and trying to work smart, not only hard. In IT, my fields of predilection these last years are IoT Solutions with all the included domains, especially at solution level (Azure). I am naturally attracted by domains related to environment, smart cities/buildings and/or automation but manufacturing, logistics, health, industry or agriculture are other fascinating domains.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more and more about IoT-related topics. I truly believe in the potential of IoT to make a better world. Right now, I try to focus on Digital Twins (the concept, not only the different products/solutions), architectures, ADX and I am planning to go a bit deeper in containerization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating value, tools and ideally, with some kinf of ROI. This might translate into extensions (Visual Studio or .NET CLI), templates, tools, simulators or on any kind of activity helping to increase/ease yield with less work. I am also trying to find ways to monetize these contributions in a balanced way to make these contributions sustainable in time.
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn or Twitter.
