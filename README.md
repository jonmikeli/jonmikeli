- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonmikeli
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. In a few words, creating value, learning, improving day after day and trying to work smart, no alwyas hard. In IT, my fields of predilection these last years are IoT Solutions with all the included domains, especially at solution level (Azure).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IoT generally speaking. This includes now Digital Twins, architectures, ADX and I am planning to go a bit deeper in containerization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating additional extensions (Visual Studio or .NET CLI) or on any kind of tooling helping to increase/ease yield with less work. I am also trying to find ways to monetize these contributions to make them fair and sustainable in time.
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn or Twitter.
