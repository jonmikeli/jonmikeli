- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonmikeli

- 👀 Always interested in learning and improving.
- Trying to create value, solve problems, and work smart, not only hard.
- My contributions try to solve actual problems and propose tangible value (Visual Studio or .NET CLI extensions, tools, templates, simulators, publications, product feedback, tests, etc).

IT fields of predilection in recent years:
 - AI Agentic solutions 
 - Azure (backend) solutions
 - IoT
 - DevOps/ALM, industrialization
 - efficient and scalable architectures (efficiency, scalability, reliability, costs, security, distributed solutions, latency, etc)

Out of IT, I am also interested in business, but I guess this field would be out of topic here.

- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn or Twitter.
