- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonmikeli

- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. In a few words, creating value, learning, improving day after day and trying to work smart, not only hard.

In IT, my fields of predilection these last years have been IoT and Azure (backend) solutions.
I am naturally attracted by domains related to environment, smart cities/buildings, real estate and/or automation but manufacturing, logistics, health, industry or agriculture are other fascinating domains.
Out of IT, I'm also interested in business but I guess this field would be out of topic here.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more and more about different types of architectures, going a bit deeper in specific data oriented services (ex: ADX) or in containerized solutions (ex: ACA and Dapr).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating value, tools and ideally, building some kind of ROI. This might translate into extensions (Visual Studio or .NET CLI), templates, tools, simulators or any kind of activity helping to increase efficiency.

I am also trying to monetize part of these contributions mainly to have the feeling to find some ROI besides technical or functional value.

- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn or Twitter.
